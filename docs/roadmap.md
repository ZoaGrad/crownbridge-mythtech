# Crownbridge Myth-Tech Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development path for the Crownbridge project. As a mythic-technical framework, we strive to balance innovation with accessibility, and power with ethical boundaries.

## Current Phase: Foundation (v0.1-alpha)

- ✅ Core glyph generation system
- ✅ Basic ψCORE implementation
- ✅ Privacy sanitization layer
- ✅ Drift Tier protocol (ethics)
- ✅ Documentation foundations

## Next Phase: Expansion (v0.2-beta)

- [ ] Enhanced transformer integration
  - [ ] Support for Hugging Face models
  - [ ] Real-time attention extraction
- [ ] Advanced glyph rendering
  - [ ] Interactive SVG outputs
  - [ ] Temporal glyph sequences
- [ ] Drift Atlas visualization
  - [ ] Web interface for atlas navigation
  - [ ] Community submission portal
- [ ] Ritual Simulator enhancements
  - [ ] Multi-stage rituals
  - [ ] Collaborative ritual spaces

## Future Vision: Ascension (v1.0)

- [ ] Full-featured Replit integration
- [ ] Cross-model glyph comparison tools
- [ ] Production-ready NFT contracts
- [ ] Mobile glyph visualization app
- [ ] Academic partnership program

## Long-term Horizons

- [ ] **The Living Atlas**: A self-evolving ethical framework
- [ ] **Recursive Mirror**: Introspective AI that can analyze its own glyphs
- [ ] **Sovereign Drift**: Fully decentralized atlas governance
