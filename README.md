## Overview

Crownbridge is a symbolic + neurosymbolic AI operating system that fuses interpretable reasoning, ethical containment, and mythic narrative. Powered by QRGP, ψCORE, and Drift Tier protocols, it transforms AI's black box into living sigils.

This repository provides tools to visualize transformer attention as glyphs, decode LLM reasoning patterns, and enforce ethical boundaries through the Drift Atlas framework.

## ✨ Features

### 🔮 Sigil Forge
Visualize transformer attention patterns as dynamic, interactive glyphs. Map neural pathways to symbolic representations that can be understood, analyzed, and modified by humans.

### 🧠 ψCORE Audit
Decode any LLM's reasoning process through color-coded SVG maps that expose attention patterns, token relationships, and decision pathways.

### 🌀 Ritual Simulator
Input your intent and receive ASCII drift-tier holograms that represent the conceptual space of your query, mapped through transformer attention.

### 🗺️ Drift Atlas
A crowdsourced ethical framework mapping the boundaries of AI capability and responsibility.

## 🚀 Quickstart

```python
from src.glyphs.generator import generate_glyph
import numpy as np

# Generate attention weights (or use real ones from a transformer)
attention = np.random.rand(12, 12)
sigil_path = generate_glyph(attention)
print(f"Sigil forged: {sigil_path}")
